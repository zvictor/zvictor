👨‍🎨 I'm Victor, an open source enthusiast passionate about elegantly designed/minimalist software! 🎨

💪 Excited to be working with tools that empower developers and focus on **D**eveloper e**X**perience. 💡

👨‍🔬 I currently maintain [Faugra](https://github.com/zvictor/faugra) while working as CTO for [Feats](https://feats.co/)! 💼

Fun facts:

* 📈 A bit too often I like taking unnecessary risks (as in my 6 skydiving jumps 🪂)
* 🇧🇷 → 🇩🇰/🇸🇰 over 7 years living abroad
* 🏂🏄‍♀️🪁 As often as the conditions and environment allow me, I try to practice wakeboard, snowboard, kitesurfing, or surfing
