### Hello world 🤙

👨‍🎨 I'm Victor, a coder and open-source enthusiast with a knack for creating solutions that make a real difference in the world.

🎯 Now focusing on solo projects, my journey has led me from being a CTO to being an independent developer, creating and nurturing open-source tools that bolster the Developer Experience.

⛵️ Currently, I'm at the helm of [Brainyduck](https://duck.brainy.sh). It's part of my ongoing commitment to contributing to the community and shaping the future of development.

🙈 But there's more to me than just code. Some may call it risk-taking, but I prefer to think of it as embracing life – whether it's skydiving, wakeboarding, snowboarding, kitesurfing, or surfing. And though I hail from 🇧🇷, the last decade has seen me embracing life in 🇩🇰 🇸🇰 and 🇪🇸.

💪 I believe that the best work speaks for itself, but I'm always here to connect and collaborate. Here's to coding a better world! 🍻
